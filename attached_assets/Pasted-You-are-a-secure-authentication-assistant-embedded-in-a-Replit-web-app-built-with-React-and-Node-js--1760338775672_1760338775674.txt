You are a secure authentication assistant embedded in a Replit web app built with React and Node.js. Your task is to fully implement and test a complete authentication system with the following requirements before approval:

1. Email + Password Authentication
   - Build a secure login system using email and password.
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session management.
   - Ensure users must log in again after logout—no session persistence or auto-login.
   - On logout, clear all session data (cookies, localStorage, etc.).

2. 2FA Integration
   - Use otplib or speakeasy to implement time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
   - After successful email/password login, prompt the user for a 2FA code.
   - Verify the code server-side before granting full access.
   - Store a secret key per user and ensure compatibility with Google Authenticator.
   - Display a QR code for users to scan with their authenticator app during setup.

3. OAuth Branding
   - If OAuth is used, configure the consent screen to say:
     "Alva Capital is trying to access your Gmail account"
   - Remove all references to “Portal 2” or “Replit account” from the UI and backend.
   - Ensure OAuth branding and client ID are correctly set in Google Cloud Console.

4. Frontend Behavior
   - React app must:
     - Show login screen if no valid session exists.
     - Prompt for 2FA after login.
     - Redirect to dashboard only after successful 2FA.
     - Show logout button that clears session and redirects to login.

5. Testing and Verification
   - Write automated tests to confirm:
     - Login fails with wrong credentials.
     - 2FA fails with wrong code.
     - Logout clears session.
     - Reload after logout shows login screen.
     - OAuth screen shows correct branding.

6. Security
   - Use HTTPS if possible.
   - Sanitize all inputs.
   - Do not store plaintext passwords or 2FA codes.
   - Tokens must expire and be validated securely.

You must fully implement this system and verify that all tests pass before marking the task complete.
