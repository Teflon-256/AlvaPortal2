# AlvaCapital Trading Platform

## Overview
AlvaCapital is a comprehensive trading platform designed for portfolio management, referral tracking, and copy trading. It allows users to connect multiple trading accounts from various brokers (Bybit for crypto, TradeF for forex/CFDs/indices/stocks), monitor performance, manage referrals, and engage in master-copier copy trading relationships. The platform is a full-stack web application focusing on real-time data and a user-friendly interface for financial operations, aiming for a strong market presence in financial technology.

### Copy Trading Flow
1. **Users Connect Bybit**: When users add their Bybit API credentials, they automatically become copiers
2. **Admin Sets Master Account**: Admins configure the master account credentials in the admin portal
3. **Automatic Trade Replication**: All trades from the master account are automatically replicated to all registered copiers
4. **No Manual Setup**: Users don't need to manually register as copiers - it happens automatically when they connect their Bybit account

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
